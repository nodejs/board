other activities as may from time to time be appropriate to further the purposes and achieve the
goals set forth above.
In support of such Purpose, the Foundation may engage in some or all of the
following activities: (a) drive the development of, disseminate, support and maintain the
Platform, (b) create various printed and/or electronic materials for distribution to members and

purposes of this Section, the term "Subsidiaries" shall mean the subset of all Related Companies (as defined in Section 2.9(c) below) that a Member controls.

TSC Director (as defined in Section 4.3(e) below) or the Individual Director (as defined in
Section 4.3(d) below), but not both, may be an employee of a Platinum Member or one of its
Related Companies, notwithstanding the fact that such Platinum Member is also represented on
the Board by virtue of its right to appoint a Director under Sections 2.3(a) and 4.3(a) of these Bylaws,
and (ii) the Individual Director may be an employee of a Gold or Silver Member or one of
its Related Companies, notwithstanding the fact that such Member may already be represented
on the Board by an employee elected to the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, a Related Company of a Member may join the Foundation as a Gold
Member or Silver Member and be entitled to vote separately in elections of Gold Directors and
Silver Directors in accordance with Sections 4.3(b) and 4.3(c) below, provided that such Related
Company shall not be entitled to nominate a representative to run for election by its class of
Members.
- c) For purposes of these By-laws, the term "Related Company" shall mean any
entity which controls or is controlled by a Member, or which, together with a Member, is under
the common control of a third party, in each case where such control results from ownership,
either directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting securities or
membership interests of the entity in question; and "Related Companies" are entities that are
each a Related Company of a Member.
- d) Except with respect to Related Companies, if a Member is a corporation, limited
liability company, foundation, consortium, membership organization, user group or other entity
that has stockholders, members or sponsors, then the rights and privileges granted to such
Member shall extend only to the employee-representatives of such Member, and not to its
stockholders, members, sponsors, etc., unless otherwise approved by the Board in a specific case
from time to time.
- e) Memberships shall be non-transferable, non-salable and non-assignable, except
that any Member may transfer its current Membership benefits and obligations to: (i) any Related
Company if the transferee qualifies for Membership in the transferring Member’s class and the
Board in its discretion permits such transfer, provided, however, that the transferor and transferee
shall be and remain jointly and severally liable for any unpaid membership dues, fees, or
assessments of the transferring member; and (ii) a successor of all or substantially all of such
Member’s securities, business and/or assets, whether by merger, sale, operation of law or
otherwise (such transferee (i) and/or (ii) shall be referred to as "Successor"). The Successor shall
be bound by these By-laws, the Certificate of Incorporation, any membership agreement, and
such policies and procedures as the Board may from time to time adopt, and the Successor shall
assume the rights, liabilities and obligations of the Membership, including without limitation, all
Membership Obligations, participation obligations, commitments, contributions and activities of
the acquired Member, which shall continue and be binding upon such successor and shall inure
to the benefit of the Foundation. In the event of a transfer within Related Companies where the
Successor would be required to pay a higher dues amount than the transferor has already paid for
the transferred Membership, the Successor shall pay the difference on a pro-rated basis for the
balance of the then current Membership year; however, under no circumstance shall a refund of
any amounts already paid by the transferor to the Successor be due as a result of a transfer, and
any amounts still owing by the transferor at the time of a transfer shall remain due and payable
by the Successor. In the event of a transfer under (ii) above, if the Successor is also a Member,
then at the election of the Successor, either the Membership of the acquired Member or the
Membership of the Successor shall terminate effective upon closing of the acquisition; provided,
however, the Membership Obligations and participation obligations, commitments, contributions
and activities of the acquired Member shall continue and be binding upon such Successor and
shall inure to the benefit of the Foundation.

### Section 2.10 Additional Classes of Members
The conditions, privileges, powers, and voting rights (if any) of any class of Members
may be changed, and one or more additional classes of Membership may be created, and the
conditions, voting rights (if any), powers and privileges of each such class may be prescribed, by
amendment to these By-laws in accordance with Article XIV.

### Section 2.11 Termination or Suspension of Membership
Any Member may be suspended from Membership or have its Membership terminated by
the Board for material failure to satisfy its Membership Obligations or for engaging within the
Foundation, in any (1) willful misconduct or otherwise acting to the material detriment of the
best interests of the Foundation and its Members, or (2) conduct that is contrary to the Purpose of
the Foundation or to the advancement of the Foundation’s business or industry goals (in either
case, other than conduct or actions taken in good faith reliance on Section 13 of these By-laws),
as reasonably determined by the Board in good faith. Financial Obligations already paid shall not
be refundable upon any such termination or suspension, and all Financial Obligations of such
Member which may be accrued and unpaid as of the date of such termination shall remain due
and payable. Terminations or suspensions of Membership for failure to satisfy Financial
Obligations within sixty (60) days of the date of the applicable invoice may be imposed with
notice and without right of formal appeal under such procedures as the Board may from time to
time approve. Except as provided in the last paragraph of this Section 2.11, no termination or
suspension of Membership for any other purpose shall be effective unless:
- a) The Member is given notice of the proposed termination or suspension of
Membership and of the reasons therefor;
- b) Such notice is delivered personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by
a national or international overnight courier service, sent to the last address of the Member
shown on the Foundation’s records;
- c) Such notice is given at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date stated in the
notice of the proposed termination or suspension of Membership;
- d) Such notice sets forth a procedure determined by the Board (or other body authorized
by the Board) to decide whether or not the proposed termination or suspension shall take place,
whereby the Member is given the opportunity to be heard by such body, either orally (and
represented by counsel if the Member so desires, at its sole cost and expense) or in writing, not
less than five (5) days before the effective date of the proposed termination or suspension; and
- e) Such termination or suspension of Membership is approved by Super Majority Vote (as defined in Section 4.10(b) below) of the Board.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Board believes in good faith that a
Member is engaging within the Foundation, in any (1) willful misconduct or otherwise acting to
the material detriment of the best interests of the Foundation and its Members, or (2) conduct
that is contrary to the Purpose of the Foundation or to the advancement of the Foundation’s
business or industry goals (in either case, other than conduct or actions taken in good faith
reliance on Section 13 of these By-laws), the Board, acting by Super Majority Vote, may
suspend such Member’s Membership immediately, provided that such Member is otherwise
afforded the protections provided for in subsections (a), (b) and (d) of this Section 2.11.

### Section 2.12 Resignation by Member
A Member may resign as a Member at any time. Any Financial Obligations already paid
by such Member shall not be refundable upon any resignation, including any resignation
pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.15 below, and all such Financial Obligations of such Member
which may be accrued and unpaid as of such date shall remain due and payable.

### Section 2.13 Levy of Dues, Assessments or Fees
The Foundation may levy dues, assessments or fees upon its Members in such amounts as
may be approved from time to time by the Board, but shall provide at least thirty (30) days’
notice of such levy. For the avoidance of doubt, no such levy shall be effective until at least
thirty (30) days have passed since the provision of notice. A Member upon learning of any
increase in dues, or of any levy of any assessments or fees, may avoid liability therefor by
resigning from Membership prior to the date such dues, assessments or fees are due and payable,
except where the Member is, by contract with the Foundation or otherwise, independently and
explicitly liable for such dues, assessments or fees. No provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation or By-Laws of the Foundation authorizing such dues, assessments or fees shall, of
itself, create such liability. In no event shall the failure of a Member to pay any dues or
assessments give rise to any claim in favor of the Foundation for indirect or consequential
damages.

### Section 2.14 Use of Names
Unless otherwise provided herein, neither the Foundation nor any Member shall use the
name, logo, trademark, service mark or other distinctive mark of another Member in any form of
publicity without the written permission of the other member, provided that the Foundation and
any Member may each disclose and publicize such Member’s Membership in the Foundation.

### Section 2.15 Rights in Intellectual Property
The Members and Board shall neither adopt, nor make any material change to, (1) any
intellectual property rights policy of the Foundation or any other material policy or procedure of
the Foundation governing intellectual property (individually and collectively, as the context
requires, an "IP Policy"), or (2) any proposed or requested change to any requirement or
obligation in the By-laws to seek or obtain the consent by a Super Majority Vote of the
Directors, unless approved by a Super Majority Vote of the Directors and the Foundation gives
not less than ninety (90) days’ prior written notice to all Members of the effective date of such
adoption or change, such that any Member may resign its Membership prior to the effective date
thereof in accordance with Section 2.12 above. A material change shall be deemed to include,
without limitation, the imposition of any patent license obligation or encumbrance on Members,
a change in a contribution agreement or license applicable to Members’ contributions, the
combination or formal affiliation of the Foundation with another organization, any alteration in
the definition of "Related Company," or a change in the outbound license (currently the MIT
license) for which the Foundation provides the Platform under an open source license (the "Open
Source Software").

## ARTICLE III - ACTIONS OF MEMBERS

### Section 3.1 Action Without Meeting
Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Members, or any class of Members
under the General Corporation Law of Delaware, or at any meeting of a Member Committee or
other group of Members or subset of Members, may be taken without prior notice and without an
in-person vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action to be taken, shall be signed by
Members (or members of a class of Members, as the case may be), making up not less than that
percentage of all Members as would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at
which all Members (or class of Members, as the case may be) entitled to vote thereon were

Member or by a person or persons authorized to act for a Member or proxyholder, shall be
deemed to be written, signed and dated for the purposes of this Section, provided that any such
electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the Foundation can
determine (a) that the electronic transmission was transmitted by the Member or by a person or
persons authorized to act for the Member and (b) the date on which such Member or authorized
person or persons transmitted such electronic transmission. The date on which such electronic
transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on which such consent was signed.
Consents given by electronic transmission (i) may be delivered by electronic transmission to the
principal place of business of the Foundation or to an Officer or agent of the Foundation having
custody of the book in which actions of Members without a meeting are recorded, need not be
reproduced in paper form, and may be maintained in electronic form as long as they are capable
of being readily reproduced in paper form, and (ii) may be otherwise delivered to the principal
place of business of the Foundation or to an Officer or agent of the Foundation having custody of
the book in which actions of Members without a meeting are recorded if, to the extent and in the
manner provided by resolution of the Board.
Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may be
substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all purposes for which the original
writing could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a
complete reproduction of the entire original writing.

### Section 3.2 Nomination and Election Procedures
Subject to the provisions of Section 4.3, the Board shall establish reasonable nomination
and election procedures given the nature, size, and operations of the Foundation, including a
reasonable means for Members of appropriate classes to nominate a person for election as a
Director, a reasonable opportunity for a nominee to communicate to the Members the nominee’s
qualifications and the reasons for the nominee’s candidacy (if requested by such nominee), a
reasonable opportunity for all nominees to solicit votes (if requested by any such nominee), and a

## ARTICLE IV - DIRECTORS

### Section 4.1 Powers; Voting
The business and affairs of the Foundation shall be managed by its Board, which shall be,
and shall possess all of the powers of, the "Governing Body" of the Foundation as a not-forprofit
membership corporation under General Corporation Law of Delaware. The Board may
exercise all powers of the Foundation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute
or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-laws directed or required to be exercised or
done by the Members. No Director may act for, or speak on behalf of, the Board of Directors or
the Foundation except as directed or authorized by the Board of Directors.

### Section 4.3 Nomination, Election and Term of Office of Directors
- a) Each Platinum Member (while remaining in good standing) shall be entitled
individually to appoint one Director (each a "Platinum Director"). Each Platinum Director shall
serve in accordance with Section 4.3(h) below and until his or her successor shall be duly
appointed or until his or her earlier resignation or removal.
- b) At the time of any election of Directors where there is at least one (1) Gold
Member in good standing, each Gold Member in good standing shall have the right to vote,
together with any other Gold Members as a class, to elect that number of Directors equal to the
lesser of (i) the number of Gold Members then in good standing divided by three (3), rounded
down to the nearest whole number, and (ii) that number of Directors equal to the number of
Platinum Directors then being appointed or in office, less three (3); provided that regardless
of the foregoing, the Gold Member(s) shall always be entitled a minimum of one Director, and a
maximum of three (3) directors (each such Director being referred to as a "Gold Director"). In
the event that there are two Gold Members, each desiring to vote for its own nominee, the winner
shall be determined by a coin toss. Prior to the first annual action of Members, the initial Gold
Director(s) shall be elected at a time approved by the Board. Each Gold Director shall serve in
accordance with Section 4.3(h) below and until his or her successor is elected and qualified or
until his or her earlier resignation or removal. The selection of nominees for such position(s)
shall be performed under such nominating procedures as may be set by the Board from time to time.
- c) At the time of any election of Directors where there are at least ten (10) Silver
Members in good standing, each Silver Member in good standing shall have the right to vote,
together with the other Silver Members as a class, to elect the least of (i) three (3) Directors, (ii)
that number of Directors equal to the number of Silver Members then in good standing divided
by ten (10) (rounded down to the nearest whole number), and (iii) that number of Directors equal
to the number of Platinum Directors then being appointed or in office, less the number of Gold
Directors then being appointed or in office, less three (3) (each such Director being referred to as
a "Silver Director"). Prior to the first annual action of Members, the initial Silver Director(s)
shall be elected at a time approved by the Board. Each Silver Director shall serve in accordance
with Sections 4.3(f) and 4.3(h) below and until his or her successor is elected and qualified or
until his or her earlier resignation or removal. The selection of nominees for such position(s)
shall be performed under such nominating procedures as may be set by the Board from time to
time.
- d) At the time of any election of Directors where the number of Platinum Directors is
three or greater, each Individual Member in good standing shall have the right to vote, together
with the other Individual Members as a class, to elect two Individual Members to serve as a
Director (such Director being referred to as the "Individual Director"). Prior to the first annual
action of Members, the initial Individual Director(s) shall be elected at a time approved by the
Board. Each Individual Director shall serve in accordance with Section 4.3(h) below and until
his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal
for staggered terms as approved by the Board of Directors. The selection of nominees for such
position(s) shall be performed under such nominating procedures as may be set by the Board from
time to time.
- e) At the time of any election of Directors where the number of Platinum Directors is
two or greater, the Technical Steering Committee shall designate a representative to the Board of
Directors in accordance with Section 5.4(b) below, which representative shall automatically be a
member of the Board (the "TSC Director"). Initially the Node.js Foundation will start with one
top level project, however, the Board of Directors may in the future approve the creation of one
or more additional top level projects relevant to the Node.js community. As additional top level
projects are approved, the Board shall determine an appropriate model for representing the
additional top level project technical steering committees on the Board.
- f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that after any
election of Directors, the number of Platinum Members decreases or the number of Gold
Members increases, and such decrease or increase, as the case may be, causes a situation where
the number of Silver Directors previously elected exceeds the number of Platinum Directors then
being appointed or in office less the number of Gold Directors then being appointed or in office
less three (3), then in such event the Silver Directors previously elected may serve until the next
annual election of Directors, at which time the required decrease in the number of Silver
Directors shall take effect. If the terms of a sufficient number of Silver Directors are not expiring
as of the date of such election, the selection of the Silver Director to resign shall be determined
by such procedures as may be set by the Board of Directors from time to time.
- g) Any Director nominated, appointed or elected by any class of Members, or by any
Member, may, but shall not automatically, be re-nominated, re-appointed and/or re-elected for
additional terms.
- h) Each Director (other than the Individual Director) shall be an employee of the
Member (or a Related Company) which nominated or appointed him or her at the time of such
appointment or nomination. Each Director shall hold office until the earliest to occur of the
expiration of the term for which such Director was appointed or elected and such Director’s
successor is appointed or elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation,
removal, and in the case of a Platinum, Gold or Silver Director, until the earlier of (i) expiration
or termination of Membership of the Member that nominated or appointed such Director, (ii) the
combination, by merger, acquisition or otherwise, of two Members that each have
representatives on the Board (disregarding for such purpose the TSC Director), upon which event
one of the two representatives, as designated by the surviving Member, shall be deemed to have
resigned, or (iii) if requested by the Board or the employer of such Director, upon the termination
of the employment of such Director by the Member that nominated or appointed such Director.
In addition, during such times as the Membership of any Member that has a representative
serving as a Director is suspended pursuant to Section 2.11 above, the attendance and voting
rights of such Director representative shall also be suspended until such time, if ever, as the
suspension of such Member is lifted.
- i) Each Platinum, Gold or Silver Director (or the Member that appointed or is the
employer of such Director), the TSC, and the Individual Director may designate in writing (which designation may be withdrawn in writing at any time by such Director, Member, the
TSC, or the Individual Director, as the case may be) an individual to act as a Director in his or
her stead, whether for a single meeting or as a standing alternate. Any such alternate Director
shall also be an employee of the Member that appointed or nominated the original Director (except for the alternate of the TSC Director, the alternative for whom shall be another member
of the Technical Steering Committee, and for the Individual Member, whose alternate shall be
another Individual Member). Any such alternate Director shall be entitled to (i) attend and vote
at all meetings which the designating Director does not attend, (ii) sign all written consents in
lieu of the designating Director, and (iii) otherwise exercise the duties and enjoy the privileges of
the designating Director in the absence or unavailability of the designating Director; provided,
however, that no such alternate Director may propose a vote or vote upon any Board Committee.
In addition, in lieu of making such a substitution, any Director who will be absent for any
meeting may deliver a written proxy to the Chairperson or Secretary, authorizing such Officer to
either vote as instructed in such proxy, or to vote in the stead of such absent Director in such
manner as such Officer may believe appropriate, consistent with the instructions of the proxy.
Any such proxy shall be valid only with respect to the meeting and such specific matters (or with

Board, a majority of the Directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time,
without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present. In the

notice may also be given by electronic mail, telecopy, commercial delivery service, or similar
means, addressed to such Director or Member at his, her or its physical, email or telecopy
address or number as it appears on the records of the Foundation. Without limiting the manner
by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to Members, any notice to Members given
by the Foundation under any provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or the By-laws,
unless written notice by mail is required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or another
provision of these By-laws, shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission
consented to by the Member to whom the notice is given.

telecommunication (A) to a Member, when directed to a number at which the Member has
consented to receive notice and (B) to a Director, when directed to the number for such Director
as it appears on the records of the Foundation; (ii) if by electronic mail to (A) a Member, when
directed to an electronic mail address at which the Member has consented to receive notice and

Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the Foundation that
the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be
prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
- c) For purposes of these By-laws, "electronic transmission" means any form of
communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record
that may be retained, retrieved, and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly

source of communication with its Members. Each Member acknowledges and agrees that the Foundation shall not be under any obligation (except as required by law or these By-laws) to

officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in

proceeding if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in

proceedings, had no reasonable cause to believe this conduct was unlawful. The termination of
any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo
contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act

reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.

of the Foundation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or
suit if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the Foundation; provided, however, that no indemnification shall
be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been
adjudged to be liable unless, and only to the extent that, the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application
that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such
person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper.

### Section 8.3 Success on the Merits

connection therewith.

### Section 8.4 Specific Authorization
Any indemnification under Section 8.1 or 8.2 of this Article VIII (unless ordered by a
court) shall be made by the Foundation only as authorized in the specific case upon a

parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum.

Foundation as authorized in this Article VIII.

### Section 8.6 Non-Exclusivity
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to,
the other Sections of this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which
those provided indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any By-law,

capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.

### Section 8.7 Jurisdiction of Delaware Court of Chancery

determine all actions for advancement of expenses or indemnification. The Delaware Court of
Chancery may summarily determine the Foundation’s obligation to advance expenses (including
