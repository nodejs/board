In support of such Purpose, the Foundation may engage in some or all of the following activities: 
(a) drive the development of, disseminate, support and maintain the Platform, 
(b) create various printed and/or electronic materials for distribution to members and non-members,

For purposes of this Section, the term “Subsidiaries” shall mean the subset of all Related Companies (as defined in Section 2.9(c) below) that a Member controls.  
(b) Only one Member which is part of a group of Related Companies (as defined below) shall be entitled at one time to have a representative on the Board or vote on matters voted on by the Members (except as otherwise provided below); provided, however, that the (i) TSC Director (as defined in Section 4.3(e) below) or the Individual Director (as defined in Section 4.3(d) below), but not both, may be an employee of a Platinum Member or one of its Related Companies, notwithstanding the fact that such Platinum Member is also represented on the Board by virtue of its right to appoint a Director under Sections 2.3(a) and 4.3(a) of these Bylaws, and (ii) the Individual Director may be an employee of a Gold or Silver Member or one of its Related Companies, notwithstanding the fact that such Member may already be represented on the Board by an employee elected to the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Related Company of a Member may join the Foundation as a Gold Member or Silver Member and be entitled to vote separately in elections of Gold Directors and Silver Directors in accordance with Sections 4.3(b) and 4.3(c) below, provided that such Related Company shall not be entitled to nominate a representative to run for election by its class of Members.    
(c) For purposes of these By-laws, the term “Related Company” shall mean any entity which controls or is controlled by a Member, or which, together with a Member, is under the common control of a third party, in each case where such control results from ownership, either directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting securities or membership interests of the entity in question; and “Related Companies” are entities that are each a Related Company of a Member.   
(d) Except with respect to Related Companies, if a Member is a corporation, limited liability company, foundation, consortium, membership organization, user group or other entity that has stockholders, members or sponsors, then the rights and privileges granted to such Member shall extend only to the employee-representatives of such Member, and not to its stockholders, members, sponsors, etc., unless otherwise approved by the Board in a specific case from time to time.  
(e) Memberships shall be non-transferable, non-salable and non-assignable, except that any Member may transfer its current Membership benefits and obligations to: (i) any Related Company if the transferee qualifies for Membership in the transferring Member’s class and the Board in its discretion permits such transfer, provided, however, that the transferor and transferee shall be and remain jointly and severally liable for any unpaid membership dues, fees, or assessments of the transferring member; and (ii)  a successor of all or substantially all of such Member’s securities, business and/or assets, whether by merger, sale, operation of law or otherwise (such transferee (i) and/or (ii) shall be referred to as “Successor”). The Successor shall be bound by these By-laws, the Certificate of Incorporation, any membership agreement, and such policies and procedures as the Board may from time to time adopt, and the Successor shall assume the rights, liabilities and obligations of the Membership, including without limitation, all Membership Obligations, participation obligations, commitments, contributions and activities of the acquired Member, which shall continue and be binding upon such successor and shall inure to the benefit of the Foundation. In the event of a transfer within Related Companies where the Successor would be required to pay a higher dues amount than the transferor has already paid for the transferred Membership, the Successor shall pay the difference on a pro-rated basis for the balance of the then current Membership year; however, under no circumstance shall a refund of any amounts already paid by the transferor to the Successor be due as a result of a transfer, and any amounts still owing by the transferor at the time of a transfer shall remain due and payable by the Successor. In the event of a transfer under (ii) above, if the Successor is also a Member, then at the election of the Successor, either the Membership of the acquired Member or the Membership of the Successor shall terminate effective upon closing of the acquisition; provided, however, the Membership Obligations and participation obligations, commitments, contributions and activities of the acquired Member shall continue and be binding upon such Successor and shall inure to the benefit of the Foundation.  
### Section 2.10 	Additional Classes of Members  
The conditions, privileges, powers, and voting rights (if any) of any class of Members may be changed, and one or more additional classes of Membership may be created, and the conditions, voting rights (if any), powers and privileges of each such class may be prescribed, by amendment to these By-laws in accordance with Article XIV.  
### Section 2.11 	Termination or Suspension of Membership  
Any Member may be suspended from Membership or have its Membership terminated by the Board for material failure to satisfy its Membership Obligations or for engaging within the Foundation, in any (1) willful misconduct or otherwise acting to the material detriment of the best interests of the Foundation and its Members, or (2) conduct that is contrary to the Purpose of the Foundation or to the advancement of the Foundation’s business or industry goals (in either case, other than conduct or actions taken in good faith reliance on Section 13 of these By-laws), as reasonably determined by the Board in good faith. Financial Obligations already paid shall not be refundable upon any such termination or suspension, and all Financial Obligations of such Member which may be accrued and unpaid as of the date of such termination shall remain due and payable. Terminations or suspensions of Membership for failure to satisfy Financial Obligations within sixty (60) days of the date of the applicable invoice may be imposed with notice and without right of formal appeal under such procedures as the Board may from time to time approve. Except as provided in the last paragraph of this Section 2.11, no termination or suspension of Membership for any other purpose shall be effective unless:  
(a) The Member is given notice of the proposed termination or suspension of Membership and of the reasons therefor;  
(b) Such notice is delivered personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by a national or international overnight courier service, sent to the last address of the Member shown on the Foundation’s records;  
(c) Such notice is given at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date stated in the notice of the proposed termination or suspension of Membership;   
(d) Such notice sets forth a procedure determined by the Board (or other body authorized by the Board) to decide whether or not the proposed termination or suspension shall take place, whereby the Member is given the opportunity to be heard by such body, either orally (and represented by counsel if the Member so desires, at its sole cost and expense) or in writing, not less than five (5) days before the effective date of the proposed termination or suspension; and  
(e) Such termination or suspension of Membership is approved by Super Majority Vote (as defined in Section 4.10(b) below) of the Board.  
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Board believes in good faith that a Member is engaging within the Foundation, in any (1) willful misconduct or otherwise acting to the material detriment of the best interests of the Foundation and its Members, or (2) conduct that is contrary to the Purpose of the Foundation or to the advancement of the Foundation’s business or industry goals (in either case, other than conduct or actions taken in good faith reliance on Section 13 of these By-laws), the Board, acting by Super Majority Vote, may suspend such Member’s Membership immediately, provided that such Member is otherwise afforded the protections provided for in subsections (a), (b) and (d) of this Section 2.11.  
### Section 2.12 	Resignation by Member  
A Member may resign as a Member at any time. Any Financial Obligations already paid by such Member shall not be refundable upon any resignation, including any resignation pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.15 below, and all such Financial Obligations of such Member which may be accrued and unpaid as of such date shall remain due and payable.   
### Section 2.13 	Levy of Dues, Assessments or Fees  
The Foundation may levy dues, assessments or fees upon its Members in such amounts as may be approved from time to time by the Board, but shall provide at least thirty (30) days’ notice of such levy. For the avoidance of doubt, no such levy shall be effective until at least thirty (30) days have passed since the provision of notice. A Member upon learning of any increase in dues, or of any levy of any assessments or fees, may avoid liability therefor by resigning from Membership prior to the date such dues, assessments or fees are due and payable, except where the Member is, by contract with the Foundation or otherwise, independently and explicitly liable for such dues, assessments or fees. No provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Foundation authorizing such dues, assessments or fees shall, of itself, create such liability. In no event shall the failure of a Member to pay any dues or assessments give rise to any claim in favor of the Foundation for indirect or consequential damages.  
### Section 	2.14 	Use of Names   
Unless otherwise provided herein, neither the Foundation nor any Member shall use the name, logo, trademark, service mark or other distinctive mark of another Member in any form of publicity without the written permission of the other member, provided that the Foundation and any Member may each disclose and publicize such Member’s Membership in the Foundation.  
### Section 2.15  	Rights in Intellectual Property  
 The Members and Board shall neither adopt, nor make any material change to, (1) any intellectual property rights policy of the Foundation or any other material policy or procedure of the Foundation governing intellectual property (individually and collectively, as the context requires, an “IP Policy”), or (2) any proposed or requested change to any requirement or obligation in the By-laws to seek or obtain the consent by a Super Majority Vote of the Directors, unless approved by a Super Majority Vote of the Directors  and the Foundation gives not less than ninety (90) days’ prior written notice to all Members of the effective date of such adoption or change, such that any Member may resign its Membership prior to the effective date thereof in accordance with Section 2.12 above. A material change shall be deemed to include, without limitation, the imposition of any patent license obligation or encumbrance on Members, a change in a contribution agreement or license applicable to Members’ contributions, the combination or formal affiliation of the Foundation with another organization, any alteration in the definition of “Related Company,” or a change in the outbound license (currently the MIT license) for which the Foundation provides the Platform under an open source license (the “Open Source Software”).

### Section 4.3 	Nomination, Election and Term of Office of Directors  
(a) Each Platinum Member (while remaining in good standing) shall be entitled individually to appoint one Director (each a “Platinum Director”). Each Platinum Director shall serve in accordance with Section 4.3(h) below and until his or her successor shall be duly appointed or until his or her earlier resignation or removal.  
(b) At the time of any election of Directors where there is at least one (1) Gold Member in good standing, each Gold Member in good standing shall have the right to vote, together with any other Gold Members as a class, to elect that number of Directors equal to the lesser of (i) the number of Gold Members then in good standing divided by three (3), rounded down to the nearest whole number, and (ii) that number of Directors equal to the number of Platinum Directors then being appointed or in office, less three (3); provided that regardless of the foregoing, the Gold Member(s) shall always be entitled a minimum of one Director, and a maximum of three (3) directors (each such Director being referred to as a “Gold Director”). In the event that there are two Gold Members, each desiring to vote for its own nominee, the winner shall be determined by a coin toss. Prior to the first annual action of Members, the initial Gold Director(s) shall be elected at a time approved by the Board. Each Gold Director shall serve in accordance with Section 4.3(h) below and until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal. The selection of nominees for such position(s) shall be performed under such nominating procedures as may be set by the Board from time to time.  
(c) At the time of any election of Directors where there are at least ten (10) Silver Members in good standing, each Silver Member in good standing shall have the right to vote, together with the other Silver Members as a class, to elect the least of (i) three (3) Directors, (ii) that number of Directors equal to the number of Silver Members then in good standing divided by ten (10) (rounded down to the nearest whole number), and (iii) that number of Directors equal to the number of Platinum Directors then being appointed or in office, less the number of Gold Directors then being appointed or in office, less three (3) (each such Director being referred to as a “Silver Director”). Prior to the first annual action of Members, the initial Silver Director(s) shall be elected at a time approved by the Board.  Each Silver Director shall serve in accordance with Sections 4.3(f) and 4.3(h) below and until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal. The selection of nominees for such position(s) shall be performed under such nominating procedures as may be set by the Board from time to time.  
(d)  At the time of any election of Directors where the number of Platinum Directors is three or greater, each Individual Member in good standing shall have the right to vote, together with the other Individual Members as a class, to elect one Individual Member to serve as a Director (such Director being referred to as the “Individual Director”). Prior to the first annual action of Members, the initial Individual Director(s) shall be elected at a time approved by the Board.  Each Individual Director shall serve in accordance with Section 4.3(h) below and until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal. The selection of nominees for such position(s) shall be performed under such nominating procedures as may be set by the Board from time to time.  
(e)  At the time of any election of Directors where the number of Platinum Directors is two or greater, the Technical Steering Committee shall designate a representative to the Board of Directors in accordance with Section 5.4(b) below, which representative shall automatically be a member of the Board (the “TSC Director”).  Initially the Node.js Foundation will start with one top level project, however, the Board of Directors may in the future approve the creation of one or more additional top level projects relevant to the Node.js community. As additional top level projects are approved, the Board shall determine an appropriate model for representing the additional top level project technical steering committees on the Board.  
(f)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that after any election of Directors, the number of Platinum Members decreases or the number of Gold Members increases, and such decrease or increase, as the case may be, causes a situation where the number of Silver Directors previously elected exceeds the number of Platinum Directors then being appointed or in office less the number of Gold Directors then being appointed or in office less three (3), then in such event the Silver Directors previously elected may serve until the next annual election of Directors, at which time the required decrease in the number of Silver Directors shall take effect. If the terms of a sufficient number of Silver Directors are not expiring as of the date of such election, the selection of the Silver Director to resign shall be determined by such procedures as may be set by the Board of Directors from time to time.  
(g) Any Director nominated, appointed or elected by any class of Members, or by any Member, may, but shall not automatically, be re-nominated, re-appointed and/or re-elected for additional terms.   
(h)  Each Director (other than the Individual Director) shall be an employee of the Member (or a Related Company) which nominated or appointed him or her at the time of such appointment or nomination. Each Director shall hold office until the earliest to occur of the expiration of the term for which such Director was appointed or elected and such Director’s successor is appointed or elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation, removal, and in the case of a Platinum, Gold or Silver Director, until the earlier of (i) expiration or termination of Membership of the Member that nominated or appointed such Director, (ii) the combination, by merger, acquisition or otherwise, of two Members that each have representatives on the Board (disregarding for such purpose the TSC Director), upon which event one of the two representatives, as designated by the surviving Member, shall be deemed to have resigned, or (iii) if requested by the Board or the employer of such Director, upon the termination of the employment of such Director by the Member that nominated or appointed such Director. In addition, during such times as the Membership of any Member that has a representative serving as a Director is suspended pursuant to Section 2.11 above, the attendance and voting rights of such Director representative shall also be suspended until such time, if ever, as the suspension of such Member is lifted.   
(i)  Each Platinum, Gold or Silver Director (or the Member that appointed or is the employer of such Director), the TSC, and the Individual Director may designate in writing (which designation may be withdrawn in writing at any time by such Director, Member, the TSC, or the Individual Director, as the case may be) an individual to act as a Director in his or her stead, whether for a single meeting or as a standing alternate. Any such alternate Director shall also be an employee of the Member that appointed or nominated the original Director (except for the alternate of the TSC Director, the alternative for whom shall be another member of the Technical Steering Committee, and for the Individual Member, whose alternate shall be another Individual Member). Any such alternate Director shall be entitled to (i) attend and vote at all meetings which the designating Director does not attend, (ii) sign all written consents in lieu of the designating Director, and (iii) otherwise exercise the duties and enjoy the privileges of the designating Director in the absence or unavailability of the designating Director; provided, however, that no such alternate Director may propose a vote or vote upon any Board Committee. In addition, in lieu of making such a substitution, any Director who will be absent for any meeting may deliver a written proxy to the Chairperson or Secretary, authorizing such Officer to either vote as instructed in such proxy, or to vote in the stead of such absent Director in such manner as such Officer may believe appropriate, consistent with the instructions of the proxy. Any such proxy shall be valid only with respect to the meeting and such specific matters (or with respect to all matters, if so desired) as may be stated in such proxy.  
 (j)  The Board may approve from time to time such reasonable attendance and other requirements as it shall deem to be advisable to ensure that seats on the Board are held by active, contributing individuals. Such rules may provide that in the event that such requirements have not been met, a Director who fails to meet such requirements shall automatically be deemed to have resigned from the Board, but no such rule may be imposed retroactively.   
### Section 4.4 	Enlargement or Reduction   
Subject to Section 2.9 above and Section 4.10 below, the number of Directors, the persons eligible to become Directors and the classes of Members eligible to appoint, elect and/or nominate Directors may be amended at any time by a Super Majority Vote (as defined in Section 4.10(b)) of the Board that includes a majority of the Platinum Directors then in Good Standing.  
### Section 4.5 	Resignation and Removal

The Foundation will conduct all of its activities in conformance with all international, U.S. federal and state antitrust laws and competition laws, including but not limited to the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, the Robinson-Patman Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act and the EU Competition Regulations. The Board and the Chairperson shall consult legal counsel and seek legal review whenever necessary to ensure that the activities of the Foundation are conducted in conformance with such laws.  
Each of the Members of the Foundation is committed to fostering competition in the development of new products and services, and the activities of the Foundation are intended to promote such competition. Each Member acknowledges that it may compete with other Members in various lines of business and that it is therefore imperative that they and their representatives act in a manner that does not violate any applicable state, federal or international antitrust laws or regulations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Members that are competitors shall not discuss issues relating to product costs, product pricing, methods or channels of product distribution, division of markets, allocation of customers, or any other topic that would be prohibited by applicable antitrust laws.  
Each Member shall assume responsibility to provide appropriate legal counsel to its representatives acting under these By-laws regarding the importance of limiting the scope of their discussions to the topics that relate to the Purpose of the Foundation, whether or not such discussions take place during formal meetings, informal gatherings or otherwise.   
### Section 13.2 	Availability of Intellectual Property  
It is the good faith objective of the Foundation (a) to make all Open Source Software available promptly as it is developed and owned by the Foundation on the same terms and conditions to all Members and at the same point in time to all Members, and (b) to make all such Open Source Software available to all non-Members under the same Open Source license(s).   
### Section 13.3 	No Obligation to Endorse  
No Member shall, by reason of its Membership or participation in the Foundation or otherwise, be obligated to license from the Foundation, use or endorse any intellectual property developed or endorsed by the Foundation, or to conform any of its products to any Platform developed or adopted by the Foundation, nor shall any such Member be precluded from independently licensing, using or endorsing similar intellectual property, platform, software, specifications or documentation developed by it or by others. No provision of these By-Laws or the membership agreement shall be interpreted to prevent any Member from using any technology or platform other than the Platform technology, or from engaging in other activities or business ventures, independently or with others, whether or not competitive with the activities contemplated herein or those of any Member.
