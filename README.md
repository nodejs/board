# Membership

The Node.js Foundation has an Individual Membership Program.

The Foundation is a member based organization. Previously the
foundation only had the ability for companies and non-profits
to be members, but as of November 2015, the Foundation also
accepts [individual humans as members][4].

Individual members of the Node Foundation have the ability to
both run and vote for representation on the [Board of Directors][5].

## 2017 Election

Nominations for the 2017 Election were posted [here][11].

The winner of the 2017 election will serve a two year term. They will join 
Ashley Williams [@ashleygwilliams](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams) who will
serve with the elected director in 2017 for the balance of the 2 year term.

For more information about Individual Membership on the Board,
see below.

## 2016 Election

Nominations for the 2016 Election were posted [here][1].

The 2016 election was the first Individual Membership Election. The winner of the 
election is serving a two year term and the runner-up is serving a one year term.
Future elections will happen each year for a new two year term.

- The board members elected in the 2016 election are:
  - Ashley Williams [@ashleygwilliams](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams) for a 2 year term.

## Representation on the Board of Directors

The Board meets every month to approve resolutions and discuss
Node.js Foundation administrative matters. This includes legal
considerations, budgeting and approving Foundation-led
conferences and other initiatives. Technical governance is
overseen by the [TSC][7], not the Board of Directors.

### Term Lengths

The standard term length for those elected by the individual
membership is 2 years, with an election each year to select
a new representative for a new term.

However, in the first (2016) election two representatives will
be elected; the representative with the most votes will be elected
for the standard 2 year term and the runner-up will serve a special
1-year term so that in 2017 we can elect a single new director for
a 2 year staggered term.
